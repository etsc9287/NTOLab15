Team Question: What factors give countries or individuals advantages over their competition in the Olympics?

```{r,echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(modelr)
library(gapminder)

#How do countrys' total populations affect olympic performance?

olympics <- read_csv("athlete_events.csv")
regions <- read_csv("noc_regions.csv") 
country_stats <- read_csv("population_total.csv")
continents <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  select(country, continent) %>%
  distinct()
#tidying

tidy_countries <- country_stats %>%
  gather(seq(2,302), key = "year", value = "population")
tidy_countries$year <- parse_double(tidy_countries$year)

olympics2 <- olympics %>%
  left_join(regions, by = "NOC") %>%
  mutate(Medal = if_else(is.na(Medal), "No Medal", Medal)) %>%
  mutate(country = region) %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(country == "USA", "United States", country)) %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(country == "UK", "United Kingdom", country)) %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(country == "Slovakia", "Slovak Republic", country)) %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(country == "Kyrgyzstan", "Kyrgyz Republic", country)) %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(country == "Macedonia", "Macedonia, FYR", country)) %>%
  mutate(year = Year)
olympics3 <- olympics2 %>%
  inner_join(tidy_countries, by = c("country", "year")) %>%
  select(-c(notes,region, Team, NOC, Games)) %>%
  left_join(continents, by = "country")

diagnose <- anti_join(olympics2, continents, by = "country")

#some countries that are not recognized in tidy_countries, such as Chinese Taipei,
#Puerto Rico, and Singapore, won't appear in this study as their populations are
#unavailable.  Countries that had different names in the two datasets, like the US,
#the UK, and Slovakia, were renamed and will appear in this study.  After diagnosing
#from anti_join, 4703 entries out of 271,116 must be dropped.
